Simple Social Media Application



A project developed during the **Hypermedia UX Engineering** course at **FH OberÃ¶sterreich Campus Hagenberg** Department of **Interactive Media**


Quantum Social allows users to connect, share, and interact.
The project uses [React](https://react.dev/) for the frontend and [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) for backend functionalities (like user authentification and NoSQL database), showcasing the integration of modern web technologies for a seamless user experience. Styling was done with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), as well as additional UI components from [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
